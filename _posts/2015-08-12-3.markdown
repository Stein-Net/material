Day 2. Pretty slow so far, woke up and watch Descendants with my little brothers. For a Disney movie it's actually pretty good. My favourite character is actually not Mal, it's Carlos. This post is going to be a little lengthy. I'm going to only post once today. I like how the moral of the story is that you don't have to follow in your parent's footprints. Oh and uh.. I turn 18 in three days so. Surprise! :D
