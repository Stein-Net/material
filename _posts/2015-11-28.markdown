It's thanksgiving break. I honestly forgot I even had this blog. Not like it matters when I don't have any readers, but I still feel the need to post it. Just in case I need to look back and see how I was feeling at certain points in time. I saw my post 'Day 1' and had to laugh. As an update, my boyfriend and I broke up in late September/Early October. I still have the best friends anyone could ask for, and there's a few guys I'm interested in- however I'm enjoying being single for now. I technically still have an internship with my dream job, however I haven't been given any projects recently (because I'm attending college.) I am currently a Freshman at SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica NY. I do still think I'm a dork for the first post, and even more of a dork for this one. My thanksgiving break was pretty interesting. I looked into Samsung's entry to the (company name here) Pay game. One pro Samsung Pay has over Google, and Apple Pay was their NFC-less terminal support. Using a changing magnetic field (https://www.looppay.com/faqs/) it can trick old credit card readers into thinking a card was swiped. I'm not sure which will be dominate in the coming years- Samsung's new trick; or old credit card terminals being given NFC support. Either way technology will move forward.'
