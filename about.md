Why STEiN?

As a child, I've always enjoyed taking things apart and putting them back together. Eventually I began doing this with computers, and other forms of technology. Because of this, I began to think of myself as a Technological-Frankenstein. The name STEiN stuck, being my first experimental program (a chatter AI), and now the name of every piece of technology I have. 


Social Media?

I can be found on nearly any form of social media. Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Google+, Ello, Kik, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, etc. You name it, you can probably find me there.
