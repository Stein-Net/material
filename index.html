            I began taking things apart as a child, starting with flashlights. I would take them apart and see 'what made them tick'. Eventually I moved on to bigger things, until one day my dad and I took a computer apart.
            <br>
            <br> As I grew up, my mother had the philosophy that if she couldn't answer my question, we could do a little research and find the answer out. This gave me a curious edge- and thanks to my already existing background in computers I began researching the computers that I was doing research on!
            <br>
            <bR> I began Android Development when I was in middle school, and in High School I had my first 'professional' gig. I designed the JROTC App for my school (Christian Brothers Academy). It was a simple enough Android app, displaying the ranks of the senior officers etc. And I maintained it through my Senior year, and have passed it down to a junior at the school. It was also in my Senior year that I recieved my first Mac from my Uncle Gary- and thus began my iOS and Mac development.
            <br>
            <br> Now! I am a student at SUNY Polytechnic Institute in New York. :)

                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4> <b>NONE!</b> Jk. I will admit, while I try to be the best I can be, I am not artistically inclined, and therefor am terrible for graphical design. I can make a simple UI, and am wonderful with the code behind the scenes, but when it comes to making icons and designing the UI- I am not the best. I still try though.
